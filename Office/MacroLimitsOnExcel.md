Yes, Microsoft Excel imposes certain limitations on formulas within a worksheet:

- **Length of Formula Contents**: A single formula can contain up to 8,192 characters.

- **Internal Length of Formula**: The internal representation of a formula is limited to 16,384 bytes.

- **Nested Levels of Functions**: You can nest functions up to 64 levels deep within a formula.

- **Arguments in a Function**: A function can have up to 255 arguments.

- **Dependency on a Single Cell**: A single cell can be referenced by up to 4 billion formulas.

These specifications are detailed in Microsoft's official documentation. citeturn0search0

While Excel doesn't explicitly limit the total number of formulas in a worksheet, performance can degrade significantly as the number of formulas increases, especially with complex calculations or limited system resources. Users have reported performance issues when worksheets contain between 10^6 to 10^8 formulas, depending on the complexity of the formulas and the system's capabilities. citeturn0search2

To optimize performance, it's advisable to:

- **Simplify Formulas**: Break down complex formulas into simpler components.

- **Use Efficient Functions**: Opt for functions that are less resource-intensive.

- **Limit Volatile Functions**: Minimize the use of functions that recalculate with every change, such as `NOW()` or `RAND()`.

- **Increase System Resources**: Ensure your system has adequate memory and processing power to handle large datasets and numerous formulas.

By adhering to these guidelines, you can maintain efficient and responsive Excel workbooks.
