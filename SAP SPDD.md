The **SPDD phase** in an SAP upgrade refers to the **Modification Adjustment for Dictionary Objects**.
It is a critical step during the upgrade process to ensure that custom modifications to SAP Dictionary objects (like tables, views, or data elements) are preserved or adapted appropriately to the new SAP version. Here's an overview of the activities and how they are performed:

### **Activities in the SPDD Phase**

1. **Identify Modified Dictionary Objects**
   - During the upgrade, SAP detects dictionary objects (like tables, structures, or views) that have been modified in the previous version and might conflict with new standard definitions.
   - These objects are flagged, and the SPDD adjustment tool lists them for review.

2. **Adjust Custom Modifications**
   - You decide whether to keep, adapt, or discard custom modifications for each flagged dictionary object.
   - Modifications typically include:
     - Adding new fields to tables or structures.
     - Changing field attributes (length, data type, etc.).
     - Custom views or database indices.

3. **Review Standard Enhancements**
   - Some objects may have been enhanced in the new SAP release. You need to decide if your custom changes should override or merge with SAP's new enhancements.

4. **Test Adjustments**
   - Ensure that your decisions do not introduce inconsistencies or errors in the system.
   - After adjustments, use tools like the **Extended Check (SLIN)** to validate your changes.

### **Steps to Perform SPDD Adjustments**

1. **Access SPDD Tool**
   - Log in to the system and execute transaction **SPDD** to display the list of modified dictionary objects requiring adjustment.

2. **Analyze Changes**
   - Compare the old version (previous SAP release) with the new version (upgraded release).
   - SAP provides a comparison tool in SPDD to view differences between custom and standard objects.

3. **Decide on Actions**
   - **Retain Modifications:** If the custom changes are still relevant, reapply or adapt them to the new SAP version.
   - **Revert to SAP Standard:** If the standard functionality in the new version meets your needs, discard the custom modifications.
   - **Merge Changes:** If necessary, manually merge custom changes with new standard enhancements.

4. **Document Adjustments**
   - Record all decisions and actions taken in the SPDD phase for future reference.

5. **Validate Adjustments**
   - Test the changes in a development or quality assurance system to ensure they do not disrupt functionality.

6. **Transport Adjustments**
   - Save the changes to a transport request so they can be moved to subsequent systems in the landscape (e.g., testing and production environments).

### **Best Practices for SPDD Phase**

1. **Perform Early Analysis**
   - Identify potentially impacted dictionary objects during the **pre-upgrade assessment** to minimize surprises during the SPDD phase.

2. **Involve Key Stakeholders**
   - Include functional and technical consultants to ensure accurate decisions regarding modifications.

3. **Leverage SAP Notes**
   - Review SAP Notes related to the upgrade for guidance on specific dictionary objects or known issues.

4. **Backup Custom Objects**
   - Ensure you have a backup of the custom modifications before making adjustments.

5. **Follow Transport Strategy**
   - Use consistent and structured transport management to avoid errors when moving changes between systems.

6. **Keep Customization Minimal**
   - Adopt SAP standard wherever possible to reduce the complexity of future upgrades.
