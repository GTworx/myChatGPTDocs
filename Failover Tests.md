After a failover during your SAP Data Center migration, it is essential to conduct thorough testing to ensure the new setup functions seamlessly. Here is a list of key tests you should perform:

---

### **1. Infrastructure and Hardware Validation**
- **Hardware functionality:** Verify the performance and stability of the new hardware.
- **Hypervisor health:** Ensure the new hypervisor is functioning as expected.
- **Network connectivity:** Test the connections between all components, including SAP application servers, database servers, and end-user networks.
- **Storage performance:** Validate that the storage systems meet SAP requirements (e.g., IOPS, latency).

---

### **2. SAP System Availability**
- **System start/stop:** Verify that SAP systems can start and stop without issues.
- **Instance availability:** Check all SAP instances (ASCS, PAS, AAS) are online.
- **Database connectivity:** Ensure SAP applications can connect to the database without errors.
- **Logon checks:** Test SAP GUI/WebGUI login for multiple users.
- **Check SM21**
- **Check ST22**
- **Check RFC Connections**
- **Check SCOT / SCON**
- **Check STMS**
- **Test a print-out**
---

### **3. Functional Testing**
- **Core SAP functionality:** Validate critical business transactions across all modules (e.g., Finance, HR, Sales).
- **Custom developments:** Test all custom programs, workflows, and interfaces.
- **Batch jobs:** Verify that scheduled batch jobs run successfully and generate expected results.
- **Reports:** Run frequently used reports and compare the output to expected values.

---

### **4. Data Integrity and Performance**
- **Database checks:** Ensure data consistency and integrity across tables and objects.
- **Performance testing:** Evaluate the response time of key transactions (e.g., VA01, ME21N, FB50).
- **Data transfer:** Test data import/export processes (e.g., IDoc, EDI, file transfers).

---

### **5. Integration Testing**
- **Third-party systems:** Test connections with integrated external systems (e.g., banks, suppliers, customers).
- **Middleware:** Verify integration through middleware tools like SAP PI/PO, CPI.
- **Web services and APIs:** Check the availability and performance of web services.

---

### **6. High Availability and Resilience**
- **Cluster failover:** Test automatic failover for application servers and databases.
- **Load balancing:** Validate load distribution across application servers.
- **Disaster recovery:** Perform a DR drill to ensure data replication works as expected.

---

### **7. Security and Compliance**
- **User authorizations:** Validate user roles and authorizations.
- **Secure connections:** Check SSL/TLS configurations for SAP systems and web interfaces.
- **Audit logs:** Ensure system logs are properly generated and stored.

---

### **8. Backup and Restore**
- **Backup verification:** Test the backup process in the new environment.
- **Restore testing:** Perform a restore from backup and verify system functionality.

---

### **9. Monitoring and Alerts**
- **System monitoring:** Validate that monitoring tools (e.g., Solution Manager) are correctly configured.
- **Alerts:** Test alert mechanisms for critical events like resource overuse or system downtime.

---

### **10. User Acceptance Testing (UAT)**
- **End-user testing:** Involve business users to test the system and confirm that it meets their requirements.
- **Feedback:** Gather user feedback to identify any unnoticed issues.

---

### **11. Documentation and Handover**
- **Update documentation:** Ensure all system and process documentation reflects the new environment.
- **Handover:** Train support teams on the new infrastructure and processes.
